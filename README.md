### Hi there ğŸ‘‹ 

I'm insoucia, a web development intern at [Bay Valley Tech](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bay-valley-tech/). I'm passionate about web development and continuously working towards becoming a better developer.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m always eager to learn new things, and I'm currently exploring the world of full-stack web development.

ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to contribute to open-source projects related to web development.
